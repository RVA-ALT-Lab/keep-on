            <h1>Keep on Teaching</h1>
            
            <p>Sometimes the unexpected happens. When it does, VCU will be prepared to keep on teaching and keep on learning. Where we have a blizzard or some other surprise event, no doubt we will eventually experience a moment where all in-person academic meetings will need to transition to a remote format. If all or part of VCU instructional locations become unavailable or need to be closed, academic continuity can maintain course progression.</p>
            <h2>The Goal = Academic Continuity</h2>

            <p>This toolkit was developed to provide faculty with options to <b>keep teaching</b> and for faculty to consider providing options for students to support them as they <b>keep learning</b>. The tips, strategies, tools, and resources below are not intended to be a comprehensive lesson in online course pedagogy. The core purpose is to support faculty with a rapid transition to remote instruction that will promote course completion. As outlined below, VCU aims to approach all aspects of academic continuity with flexibility, care, compassion, kindness, creativity, and positivity. </p>

            <h2>General Principles</h2>
            <p><b>Be proactive- </b>As you prepare for change, a proactive approach before the urgent needs arises is always the preferred approach.  Nothing beats getting prepared in advance for any unexpected situation that may require in-person courses and other academic work to be rapidly converted to a remote or online format. The more you prepare in advance, the easier the transition.</p>

            <p><b>Prioritize care, compassion, kindness- </b>Some of your students may need to miss class, find alternate ways to submit assignments depending on their technology/wifi access, or request an extension for an assignment/exam. Knowing that you care about them and their success may make all the difference in their motivation, persistence, and ultimate success in course completion. </p>

            <p><b>Stay calm-</b> Students look to you for leadership. If students see that you are calm and that you are assuring them everything will be ok with the course, that will go a long way to keep them positive and engaged. You set the tone for helping your students stay calm.</p>

            <p><b>Keep it simple- </b>Please do not expect to launch a fully online course that would typically take 18 months to develop. Choose tools that are already in use by both you and the students.You do not need all the bells and whistles to be effective. Keep it simple and choose technology tools that will support your particular learning goals and needs. </p>

            <p><b>Practice pedagogical flexibility</b>- In times of rapid transition to remote teaching, flexibility goes a long way. Pedagogical flexibility allows us to get creative with assignment design, exam format, options for students such as choosing from a list of projects, interactive discussions, avenues for student submission of their work, etc. At its core, teaching is a creative process. </p>

            <p><b>Support our student community-</b> keep in mind under-served and marginalized students may experience disproportionate stressors including lack of resources or need for an accessible format. Your support and flexibility can make all the difference in student success.</p>

            <p><b>Seek support from colleagues</b>- We encourage faculty to stay in communication with colleagues both in your own department and also across the university for ideas on how best to transition to remote teaching. There are likely some discipline-specific needs that may be solved with creativity in brainstorming with faculty teaching similar content. </p>
