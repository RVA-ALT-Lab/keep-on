               <h1>Keep on Learning</h1>
               <p>Sometimes the unexpected happens. When it does, VCU will be prepared to keep on teaching and keep on learning. Were we to have a blizzard or some other surprise event, no doubt we will eventually experience a moment where all in-person courses will need to transition to a remote format. Don’t worry! Your professors will do everything they can to make sure your course stays on track.</p>
               <h2>The Goal = Keep Learning</h2>
               <p>This toolkit was developed to provide students resources and support as they keep learning. The tips, tools, and resources below are here to support students with unexpected transition to remote learning and promote course completion. As outlined below, VCU aims to approach all aspects of academic continuity with flexibility, care, compassion, kindness, creativity, and positivity.</p>

             <h2>The Ram Frame of Mind</h2>
             <p>
                 <strong>Be well</strong>- Our main priority is your health! Please check out the health tips and FAQs on the <a href="https://health.students.vcu.edu/">VCU University Health Services</a>. 
             </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Be proactive</strong>- The more you prepare in advance, the easier the transition. Update your contact information with VCU. At least once a day, check your <a href="http://mail.google.com/a/mymail.vcu.edu">VCU email</a> and any course communication tools (for example, <a href="https://blackboard.vcu.edu/">Blackboard</a>) for updates. 
             </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Stay calm</strong>- Even though you may feel quite stressed or uncertain, try your best to breathe in, breathe out, repeat. Staying calm can help you focus, make a plan, keep yourself organized, and make logical decisions. 
             </p>
             <p>
                 <strong>Embrace integrity</strong> - Continue to embrace and adhere to the VCU academic integrity policy. Rams are leaders with regard to taking the <a href="https://conduct.students.vcu.edu//vcu-honor-system/academic-misconduct-/honor-pledge/">VCU honor pledge</a> seriously. 
             </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Practice flexibility</strong>- Your instructors may be learning new things as well. They will be looking at creative ways to deal with assignments, exams, discussions, avenues for student submission of their work, etc. In the end, just put your best foot forward and be open to change.  
             </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Seek support from your classmates</strong>- We encourage you to stay in communication with other students in your own classes and across the university. Find out what’s working for other students and how they’re managing the shift. It’s likely you’ll find different tools and workflows that will be helpful while sharing your own successes. 
             </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Prioritize care, compassion, kindness</strong> - Supporting each other can go a long way. Practice compassion and kindness to your classmates and your faculty. Everyone is doing their best to maintain your courses and stay on track for the semester.
             </p> 
              <p>
                <strong>Speak up if you need to talk</strong>- In times like these, you may need to talk to someone who can listen, support you, and help you focus on your learning. We really do encourage you to reach out to your Academic Advisor if you want to talk. Not sure who is your current advisor, <a href="https://academicadvising.vcu.edu/find/">find your advisor here</a>. They are there for you!! The VCU <a href="https://counseling.vcu.edu/">University Counseling Services</a> is another great source on campus for students.

                          <p>Academic advisors continue to be your best “one stop” resource for many of your questions.  They are very resourceful and can help connect you to important resources, help you navigate conversations with your professors, and also be a source of calm in these new waters of remote learning.</p>

                          <p>All students should plan to schedule an advising appointment as soon as they can to discuss their current courses, midterm grades, withdrawal deadline questions, goal planning, and Fall 2020 pre-registration.</p>

                            <li>Fall 2020 course registration begins on March 31st (this is a date change).  Please review what day you can <a href="https://rar.vcu.edu/registration/dates/">register for classes</a> and try to “meet” (remotely) with your advisor prior to this important date.</li>

                          <p>On March 17th, VCU Human Resources provided the following <a href="https://orange.hosting.lsoft.com/list/ov8ia944/200317AF/7b2j98czdxny.vib?a0=2066">update</a> for students who are student workers or federal work study employees:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Students who are part of the federal work-study program will be paid up to the amount of their award on the normal semi-monthly pay schedule.</li>
                            <li>Student workers (non-federal work-study) will have their payments continued for at least the next 30 days unless return to campus occurs before April 15 and they return to work. University leadership will issue additional guidance once a decision about student presence on campus is made.</li>
                            <li>Payment will be a calculated weekly rate based upon scheduled hours, as reflected in past earnings between January 13 and March 6. Payment will continue on a semi-monthly basis and will be calculated by Payroll Services.</li>
                            <li>Some students whose work is or can be performed remotely, such as student tutors or help desk support, will be asked to continue working and will be provided with premium pay (1.5 times your regular hourly rate).

                          </ul>
                          <h3>Unemployment Benefits</h3>

                          <p>On March 12, 2020, Governor Northam declared a State of Emergency in the Commonwealth due to the state-wide spread of COVID-19. Governor Northam announced the following <a href="https://www.virginia.gov/coronavirus-updates/">actions</a> to protect working Virginians impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><em>No waiting for unemployment benefits</em>. Governor Northam has directed the Commissioner of the Virginia Employment Commission to waive the one-week waiting period to ensure workers can receive benefits as soon as possible.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                            <li><em>Enhanced eligibility for unemployment. </em>Workers may be eligible to receive unemployment benefits if an employer needs to temporarily slow or cease operations due to COVID-19. If a worker has been issued a notice to self-quarantine by a medical or public health official and is not receiving paid sick or medical leave from their employer, they may be eligible to receive unemployment benefits. In addition, a worker may be eligible for unemployment benefits if they must stay home to care for an ill family member and are not receiving paid family medical leave from their employer.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                            <li><em>Fewer restrictions.</em> For individuals receiving unemployment insurance, Governor Northam is directing the <a href="http://www.vec.virginia.gov/node/11699">Virginia Employment Commission</a> to give affected workers special consideration on deadlines, mandatory re-employment appointments, and work search requirements.</li>
                          </ul>
